This page provides some basic guidance on getting up and running with your first SAFE application.

## Install pre-requisites

You'll need to install the following pre-requisites in order to build SAFE applications

* The [.NET Core SDK 2.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/).
* [FAKE 5](https://fake.build/) installed as a [global tool](https://fake.build/fake-gettingstarted.html#Install-FAKE)
* The [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) package manager.
* [Node 8.x](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed for the front end components.
* If you're running on OSX or Linux, you'll also need to install [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/).

## Install an F# code editor

You'll also want an IDE to create F# applications. We recommend one of the following great IDEs.

* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Ionide](https://github.com/ionide/ionide-vscode-fsharp) extension
* [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)
* [Jetbrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)

## Create your first SAFE app

1. Create a new directory on your machine
2. Open a command prompt
3. Enter `dotnet new -i SAFE.Template` to install the [SAFE project template](template-overview.md)
4. Enter `dotnet new SAFE` to create a new SAFE project
5. Enter `fake build --target run` to build and run the app

Congratulations - after a short delay, you'll be presented with a basic SAFE application running in your browser! The application will by default run in "development mode", which means it automatically watch your project for changes; whenever you save a file in the client project it will refresh the browser **automatically**; if you save a file in the server project it will also restart the server in the background.

Take a look at the [template options](template-overview.md#template-options.md). There are several ways to customise the default application, such as server and client/server communication technologies.

## Troubleshooting

* **fake not found** - If you fail to execute `fake` from command line after installing it as a global tool, you might need to add it to your `PATH` manually: (e.g. `export PATH="$HOME/.dotnet/tools:$PATH"` on unix) - [related GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/9321)
