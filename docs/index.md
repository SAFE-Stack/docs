Welcome to the SAFE documentation site! This site contains all the documentation you'll need to quickly starting creating SAFE apps in F#. If you've not heard of SAFE before, please feel free to start with the [introduction](intro). Alternatively, you can immediately try out the [quick start](quickstart) guide and tutorial, or simply browse through the documentation.

If there's anything missing from here, please feel free to add the documentation directly (or supply an issue) to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SAFE-Stack/docs).

We hope you enjoy using SAFE as much as we do!

The SAFE team.
