This article shows the steps required in order to create a SAFE Stack 5-style app from scratch. [This repository](https://github.com/CompositionalIT/safe-from-scratch) should be used as a guide to follow whilst reading this tutorial; each section links to a specific commit from the [history of the repository](https://github.com/CompositionalIT/safe-from-scratch/commits/main/).

## 1. Folders and tools
This first section creates some basic folders and tools that will simply coding going forwards and represents some best practices.

### 1.1 [Create a basic source-controlled repository](https://github.com/CompositionalIT/safe-from-scratch/commit/eef17c091ac66e65c02e15267c6327ccb9e848c1)
* Create a new folder.
* Put the folder under source controlled:
```bash
git init
```
* We recommend also creating a `.gitignore` file to ensure that you do not accidentally commit unnecessary files into your repository. *[This example file](https://github.com/CompositionalIT/safe-from-scratch/blob/main/.gitignore) has been generated through VS Code and fine-tuned with extra files / folders required for SAFE Stack applications.*

### 1.2 [Set up basic tooling support](https://github.com/CompositionalIT/safe-from-scratch/commit/21e62db348f6f58046558053313e93338003b7b6)
* Create standard dotnet tooling support with \`dotnet new tool-manifest`.
* Install the Fantomas tool for F# formatting.
```bash
dotnet tool install fantomas
```
* We also recommend creating an `.editorconfig` file which configures Fantomas as required for optimal F# formatting.
* You should also create a basic [`global.json` file](https://github.com/CompositionalIT/safe-from-scratch/blob/main/global.json) to pin the repository to a specific version of .NET.
```bash
dotnet new global.json
```

## 2. Creating client & server
Now that we have basic core tools installed, we can go about creating a basic F# server and client and get them to communicate with one another.

### 2.1 [Create a basic server application](https://github.com/CompositionalIT/safe-from-scratch/commit/90b4fcb6ef948886bb872b3b24d3e5a9d21ecdc0)
* Create a folder e.g. `server`.
* Create a plain F# console application
```bash
dotnet new console -lang F#
```
* Reference the **Giraffe** NuGet package (if you wish to use Paket, feel free to install that tool at this point).
* Create a basic Giraffe application to e.g. simply return the text "Hello world!" for every request.
* Run the application and confirm that it returns the expected text.
```bash
dotnet run
```

### 2.2 [Create a basic client application](https://github.com/CompositionalIT/safe-from-scratch/commit/0c05a1022357b5dd3b2a43d8f3738dcff161b6b4)
* Create a folder e.g. `client`.
* Create another plain F# console application in it.
* Add the Fable dotnet tool.
```bash
dotnet tool install fable
```
* To prove that Fable is installed, you should now be able to transpile the stock "Hello from F#" console app into JavaScript.
```bash
dotnet fable
```

### 2.3 [Create a basic web application](https://github.com/CompositionalIT/safe-from-scratch/commit/ac025b31ab49506a8a6199e80ac0825147e21b95)
Now that we have a running HTTP server and the ability to create JS from F#, we can now install the required browser libraries and tools required to host a full app in the browser.

* Create an `index.html` file that will be used as the launch point for the web application; it will also load the JS that is generated by Fable.
* Install **Vite** with npm (install NPM and Node if you haven't already!).
```bash
npm install vite
```
> Vite is a multi-purpose tool used to aid the development and packaging of JavaScript applications.
* You can now launch the application.
```bash
dotnet fable watch -o output -s --run npx vite
```
    This command tells Fable to compile all F# into the `output` folder and then launches Vite, which acts as a local development web server.

* You should see the output in your terminal similar to this:

![](img/safe-from-scratch-1.png)

* Browse to the Local URI displayed e.g. `http://localhost:5173` in your browser and view the console output using the dev console (normally `F12`). You should see the console output from your client's `Program.fs` e.g.

![](img/safe-from-scratch-2.png)

### 2.4 [Set up basic Client / Server communication](https://github.com/CompositionalIT/safe-from-scratch/commit/a14a7c9ca117da3b00da4187c6a68bd1cba0b5a3)
Now that we have running client and server F# applications, let's have them communicate with each other over HTTP. We'll use a basic library for this called SimpleHttp.

* Start by adding a configuration file for Vite, `vite.config.mts` which will tell it to redirect traffic destined for the server (which we assume always starts with `/api/`) to port 5000 (which is the port the server runs on).
> See [here](faq/faq-build.md) for more information about this redirection process.
* Add a simple button to the HTML which we will be using handle the "on click" event to communicate with the server.
* Add the **Fable.SimpleHttp** package to the Client project.
* Change your Client `Program.fs` to handle the on-click event of the button so that when it is clicked, it makes a request to e.g. `/api/data` and puts the response in the console and a browser alert.
* Start **both client and server applications**.
* Confirm that when you click the button in the browser, you get the response "Hello world" (sent from the server).

Congratulations! At this stage, you have a working F# client / server application that can communicate over HTTP.

## 3. Adding React
We now spend the next few steps getting React working within the app and with F# support.

### 3.1 [Add basic React support](https://github.com/CompositionalIT/safe-from-scratch/commit/0b331ad76fdc59442bf8024d4300ae1073a20715)
Now that we have a (very) basic F# client/server app, we'll now add support for React - a front-end framework that will enable us to create responsive and rich UIs.

* Add the **react** and **react-dom** packages to your NPM dependencies.
* Add the **@vitejs/plugin-react** and **remotedev** packages to your NPM dev dependencies.
* Add react to the list of plugins in your Vite config.

### 3.2 [Add F# React support](https://github.com/CompositionalIT/safe-from-scratch/commit/1409820300e2b09db11003c077ff3e2c82f6d9d2)
Now that we have React added to our application, we can add the appropriate F# libraries such as Feliz to start to use React in a typesafe, F#-friendly manner.

* Add the **Feliz** NuGet package to the Client project.
* Remove the `<button>` element from the `index.html` - we'll be creating it dynamically with React from now on.
* Add an empty `<div>` with a named `id` to the body of the `index.html`. This will be the "root" element that React will attach to from which to make HTML elements.
* Using the Feliz React wrapper types, replace the contents of your `Program.fs` in the Client project so that it creates a React button that can behave as the original static HTML button.

### 3.3 [Add JSX support *(optional)*](https://github.com/CompositionalIT/safe-from-scratch/commit/78e4093502ec4b8281ec5c14f113e3ad14b4a6f6)
This next step adds Feliz's JSX support, which allows you to embed standard React JSX code directly in your F# applications.

* Add the **Fable.Core** and **Feliz.Jsx.React** NuGet packages to the Client project.
* Instead of using the Feliz F# dialect for React components (such as the `button []` element), use standard JSX code with string interpolation.
* Reference `Program.jsx` instead of `Program.js` in your `index.html` file.
* Run the client application using the extra flag that instructs Fable to emit `.jsx` instead of `.js` files:

```bash
dotnet fable watch -o output -s -e .jsx --run npx vite
```

## 4. Taking advantage of F\#
This next section takes advantage of F#'s typing for both client and server.

### 4.1 [Add type-safe Client / Server communication](https://github.com/CompositionalIT/safe-from-scratch/commit/0e47e2fd3d56c6213474dc1af485fa8077375b3a)
* **On the Server**:
    * Add the **Fable.Remoting.Giraffe** package.
    * Create a new folder, `shared`, and a `Contracts.fs` file  inside it.
    * Reference this file from both Client and Server projects.
    * Inside this file create an API type and a Route builder to be used by Fable Remoting (so that the client and server can route traffic).
    * On the Server, create an implementation of the Api you just defined, convert it to an Http Handler and replace the `text  "Hello world"` call with it.
* **On the Client**:
    * Add the **Fable.Remoting.Client** package.
    * Instead of using SimpleHttp to make client / server calls, create a Fable Remoting API proxy and use that.

### 4.2 [Add Elmish support](https://github.com/CompositionalIT/safe-from-scratch/commit/1e39a36133ee26c18ddb4f08c11858b33cbaeea1)
Elmish is an F# library modelled closely on the Elm language model for writing browser-based applications, which has popularised the "model-view-update" paradigm.

* Add the **Fable.Elmish.Debugger**, **Fable.Elmish.HMR** and **Fable.Elmish.React** packages.
* Create a set of standard model, view and update types functions.
* Update your basic application root to use Elmish instead of a "raw" ReactDOM root.
* Ensure you add the required polyfill for remotedev in `index.html`.

## 5. More UI capabilities
This last section adds more UX capabilities.

### 5.1 [Add Tailwind support](https://github.com/CompositionalIT/safe-from-scratch/commit/fb8b8d02ac4b9b8e97292af23bf37bcee917daff)
Follow the [Tailwind](recipes/ui/add-tailwind.md) guide to add Tailwind to your project.
### 5.2 [Revert to "standard" F# Feliz](https://github.com/CompositionalIT/safe-from-scratch/commit/ce4705c5d497cbebf91ea2e4f74dbd0345901e28) *(optional)*
If you do not want to use the JSX support:

* Remove references to Feliz.JSX
* Do not use `JSX.jsx` to create components but rather standard `[ReactComponent]`.
* Use the standard Feliz types for creating standard React elements such as `div` and `button` etc.
