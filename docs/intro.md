## What is SAFE?
The SAFE stack is **the best way to write functional-first web applications**.

The SAFE stack allows you to **develop web applications** almost entirely in [F#](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/languages/fsharp/), without needing to compromise and shoehorn your codebase into an object-oriented framework or library, and without needing you to be an expert in CSS or HTML to create compelling, rich client-side web applications. SAFE Stack is:

* Open-source
* Free
* Type-safe
* Flexible
* Cloud-ready

The SAFE stack is made up of four components:

* A **web server** running on .NET for hosting back-end services in F#
* A **hosting platform** that provides simple, scalable deployment models plus associated platform services for application developers
* A mechanism to run F# in the web browser for **client-side delivery of F#**
* An F# programming model for **client-side user interfaces**

## Why SAFE?
SAFE provides developers with a simple and consistent programming model for developing rich, scalable web-enabled applications that can run on multiple platforms. SAFE takes advantage of F#'s functional-first experience backed by the powerful and mature .NET framework to provide a type-safe, reliable experience that leads to the "pit of success".

* Create client / server applications entirely in F#
* Re-use development skills on client and server
* Rapidly create rich client-side web applications with no Javascript knowledge
* Runs on the latest .NET (and tested daily by Microsoft)
* Rapid development cycle with support for [hot module replacement](feature-hmr.md)
* Interact with native Javascript libraries whenever needed
* Create client-side applications purely in F#, with full type checking for safety
* Seamlessly share code between client and server
